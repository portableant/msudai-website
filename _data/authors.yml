bencarter:
  name: 'Ben Carter'
  bio: 'I received by Ph.D. in Anthropological Sciences from Washington University in St. Louis in 2008. My main focus has been how communities are built. A central concern of my dissertation on shell bead production  on the coast of Ecuador (between c. A.D. 800- 1530) is how the identity of bead makers is developed as a community and how it is embodied. Currently (2017), I am working on two projects. The first is about how the landscapes of late prehistoric Ecuador were both employed by and fashioned by the Guancavilcas while constructing a unique local identity. Second, I am also looking at how the landscape of the Blue Mountain in eastern Pennsylvania, which looks “natural” today,  was used by colliers (charcoal makers) to supply fuel to two iron furnaces in the 19th century. Overarching all of this is a deep concern with openness in archaeology. I am working on designing- using only open tools and open standards- a data base that can be shared publicly (while protecting vital data).'
