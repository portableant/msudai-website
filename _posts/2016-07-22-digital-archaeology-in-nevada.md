During July I have concentrated on building the objects for the Cave Rock Website â€“ building the timeline with historic photos and the 3D representation of Cave Rock before 1849.

As our institute project gets closer to launching, I have realized that my exposure to open source programs and public archaeology has expanded throughout my workplace. One of the first things I did when I got back from MSU last August was to present a synopsis of open source software, and the goals of public archaeology to my peers.

## Practical Applications

A few examples of how we put this to use:

We are using **Trello** to process Nevada's FHWA Bridge Program Comment. In Trello, we placed NDOT's entire bridge inventory out for review and comment on exempting certain post-1945 bridges from further Section 106 review. We were able to include the inventory, pictures of bridges types, and a pictorial glossary of the bridge elements. The comment period has now closed and we are compiling the comments for ACHP review. Trello made it much easier to share information and supporting media, and is expected to result in exempting over 1600 mass-produced bridges statewide.

Using **SketchFab**, we shared 3D objects of late Pleistocene grasshoppers from an early food cache with entomologists nationwide for study. The grasshoppers represent a poorly understood subspecies in the Great Basin. The archaeologist working on the analysis, Evan Pellegrini, has made many new research contacts and now has more collaborative opportunities for his project.

Several years ago, one of our custom built programs became unsustainable and was abandoned. Using **OpenRefine**, we are reformatting the data stored in that program to relate it back to spatial data in GIS. By recovering the legacy data, we now have robust access to thirty years of cultural field data reports throughout Nevada.

## Key Outcomes

The big takeaways have been expanded research, a wider audience for the data, and the recovery of important legacy data. Thanks Digital Archaeology!
