Well, its official folks – the application deadline for the NEH funded Institute for Digital Archaeology Method and Practice has passed. Quite honestly, we're blown away by the amount of interest the institute has received. We received 187 applications from every corner of the archaeological (and associated disciplinary) world. CRM companies, state and federal institutions, museums, heritage institutions and organizations, universities, archives, libraries, and independent scholars – all were represented from among the applicants. We were particularly impressed that from the academic world, applications ranged from the most junior of graduate students to department chairs (and even a Dean).

## Selection Process

Now the hard part (the really hard part) – choosing 20 people to accept….a spectacularly difficult undertaking given the clear quality of all who took the time to apply. So, sit tight – we'll make the selection over the next month and send out acceptance emails by March 15th. In the meantime, if you have any questions about the institute, don't hesitate to let us know.
