I am Mary Lennon from AECOM's Cultural Resource Management (CRM) Office in Burlington, NJ. I will be doing a project based on one of our most recent excavations. Before I can announce the particulars, there are a few conversations that need to happen with our client. I will update you all in the very near futureâ€¦stay tuned!

## Project Vision

For now, I can tell you that this project aims to connect our client (who wishes to fund-raise to do additional work), the general public, and a group of interested scholars to each other through the artifacts found at the site. The goal is to explore how to best connect artifacts to the location where they were found and the public, while creating and maintaining a dialog will last longer than a news article or paper report. The project, at present, intends to take form as a website that will include an interactive map and dynamically linked artifact inventory.

I can't wait to announce the rest!

Mary
