Brian Geyer is a 4th year PhD student of anthropology at Michigan State University. His research regards the adaptive strategies Maa-speaking peoples undertake to adjust their land tenure customs to rapidly changing wildlife conservation practices near the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya. He was a Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship recipient for the first three years of his graduate studies, a Fulbright-Hays Group Project Abroad member for a language program in Tanzania, and – prior to his graduate studies – served as a public health volunteer in Kenya through the United States Peace Corps. He has BAs in music and anthropology from Washington State University.

Brian currently serves as a research assistant for theLab for the Education and Advancement in Digital Research (LEADR), a joint program between the departments of history and anthropology. His duties involve collaboration with faculty regarding digital projects, instruction of undergraduates in digital tools relevant to those projects, and advisement to graduate students and faculty members on digital research projects. He has also completed two projects as a member of the anthropology department’s Cultural Heritage Informatics Fellowship. His first is Kenya-Tweet, which is an (almost) real-time geospatial tweet mapping project (kenya-tweet.matrix.msu.edu). His second, Remnants of Slavery, is a 3D visualization project involving several scanned archaeological objects from Gorée Island off the coast of Mali (remnantsofslavery.matrix.msu.edu).
