Shawn Graham is an associate professor in the history department at Carleton University. His digital archaeological work involves the use of small-scale agent based models to explore Roman social space, 3d photogrammetry for teaching & public outreach with museums, and data mining to see what can be squeezed from archaeological data sets. He blogs at electricarchaeology.ca and is all over twitter as @electricarchaeo. Currently he is teaching a seminar on the illegal antiquities trade (from a data mining perspective), and a course on digital research methods for historians.
