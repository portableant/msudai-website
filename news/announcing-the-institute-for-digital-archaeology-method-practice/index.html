                        <p>Archaeology has a long history of innovative work with information and computing technologies. One of the earliest example comes from James Deetz’s seminal work on Arikara ceramics carried out in the very early 1960s. Deetz used an IBM mainframe (the IBM704 at the MIT Computation Laboratory, to be precise) to discover “stylistic coherence” on over two thousand rim sherds from central South Dakota’s Medicine Crow site. Deetz’s work was extremely important as it suggested that computers were excellent tools for statistical, typological, chronological, or stylistic analysis of large, complex, and messy sets of data (a hallmark of archaeology). Since these early and formative days, the focus on the storage, analysis, and preservation of digital data has remained paramount within the archaeological community.</p>

<h2 id="early-digital-adoption-in-archaeology">Early Digital Adoption in Archaeology</h2>

<p>By the mid-1980s, desktop computers had reached a point where they were great tools for data visualization and archaeological imagery. One of the most important examples of this was the emergence of Geographic Information Systems. GIS is one of the most important domains in archaeology as it not only allows for the visualization of spatial and map-based data (in the context of survey and documentation of archaeological resources), but for the analysis and modeling of archaeological socio-spatial data. Archaeologists were among the earliest adopters of GIS, and remain one of the largest user groups in the sciences, social sciences, and the humanities. Instruction in the archaeological application of GIS is one of the central pillars of digital methods training (both at the graduate and undergraduate levels) in most anthropology departments. In addition to GIS, many archaeologists turned to desktop computers for drafting purposes. Computer Assisted Design (CAD) allowed archaeologists to produce highly detailed and geometrically accurate archaeological plans, profiles, and feature maps at various scales and with differing emphases and without time-consuming redrafting.</p>

<h2 id="the-current-challenge">The Current Challenge</h2>

<p>On one hand, in absorbing these digital methods into its core disciplinary fabric, archaeology has far surpassed many other disciplines in the humanities in social sciences in its “digitalness.” On the other hand, focusing on these specific digital domains has largely cut archaeology off from the wider world of digital practice that has evolved in information science, computer science, the digital humanities, digital libraries, open web development, user experience design, and the world of open source software. This is a problem.</p>

<p>Archaeology is in an age where broader digital methods and practices are having an unavoidable impact on all areas of the discipline. Research, teaching, compliance, preservation, public engagement, and publication – all are being transformed by digital tools and technologies. While there are lots of opportunities to learn GIS, CAD, or database design, there are far fewer opportunities for students, scholars, professional archaeologists, or closely related disciplines to get hands-on experience in other, vital digital skills.</p>

<h2 id="the-institute-solution">The Institute Solution</h2>

<p>It is within this context that we are very happy to announce the official launch of the <strong>Institute for Digital Archaeology Method &amp; Practice</strong>. Generously funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities (Office of Digital Humanities), the institute is co-organized by the Michigan State University Department of Anthropology and MATRIX: The Center for Digital Humanities and Social Sciences. The institute will take place on the beautiful campus of Michigan State University in 2015 (August 17-22) &amp; 2016 (August 15-20).</p>

<p>Quite simply, the purpose of the institute is to provide invited attendees the opportunity to receive hands-on instruction and experience in a wide variety of critical digital skills, tools, and technologies – specifically those that fall outside the “traditional” suite of digital tools with which many archaeologists are already comfortable (CAD, GIS, databases, etc). We’ve assembled a group of well respected and internationally recognized faculty (from both inside and outside of the archaeological community) who will give lecture, lead hands-on workshops, and mentor institute attendees. Peruse the list of faculty, the tentative 2015 schedule, or the institute themes for more information.</p>

<h2 id="project-based-learning">Project-Based Learning</h2>

<p>While participants will attend lectures, participate in hands-on workshops, and collaborate on small scale rapid development projects, the organizational focus is on a significant digital archaeology capstone project which attendees will be challenged to envision, design, develop, and launch during the institute. The idea behind this is that invited attendees will get far more experience with digital archaeological methods and practice by actually building things.</p>

<h2 id="application-information">Application Information</h2>

<p>The institute is open to private sector, public sector, grad student, and academic archaeologists (of all disciplinary extractions). We also invite applications from scholars and practitioners from affiliated fields who regularly engage with archaeologists, archeological topics, or archaeological materials (museum professionals, historic preservation professionals, etc). Acceptance to the institute is by application only – and the institute will only be accepting 20 people to attend (if you are accepted, you will attend both years of the institute). The good news is that the institute will cover room, board, and travel for all invited attendees. Applications close on <strong>February 15th, 2015 (5pm EST)</strong>. Applicants will be notified no later than <strong>March 15, 2015</strong>.</p>

<p>Any questions about the institute can be sent via email to either myself (<a href="mailto:watrall@msu.edu">watrall@msu.edu</a>) or Lynne Goldstein (<a href="mailto:lynneg@msu.edu">lynneg@msu.edu</a>).</p>

<p>We very much look forward to receiving your applications!</p>
