<h2 id="current-state-of-digital-field-collection">Current State of Digital Field Collection</h2>

<p>Beyond my own experience, archaeologists have been shifting towards collecting data digitally in the field for some time. These systems can be as simple as using an app on a smart phone or as complex as setting up a WiFi network- including a server (laptop) and multiple data collection devices (such as iPads)- in the field. We have done this largely to reduce both time spent converting paper-based data to digital as well as to reduce the errors introduced in this process. Also, a digital collection system is simply the first stage of a digital pipeline that funnels data to both online publishing and archival platforms. However, many of the systems developed within archaeology have been hampered by five major concerns:</p>

<h2 id="five-major-limitations">Five Major Limitations</h2>

<p><strong>First</strong>, many employ proprietary software (Filemaker Pro is one of the best known) and/or hardware that limit the integration, analysis and open dissemination of data and restrict flexibility. Similarly, once entangled in proprietary software and hardware, it is extremely difficult to leave- at least partially because they have a steep learning curve.</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, the cost of proprietary software and the devices needed to deploy it limit its applicability to larger, well-funded academic projects or CRM companies. Smaller groups and individuals, including small academic teams, faculty at small less-well-funded schools, graduate students, and small CRM firms, cannot sustainably afford these systems, even if the may be able to afford a one-time purchase.</p>

<p><strong>Third</strong>, while proprietary software often supplies a wide array of options making it attractive, they can neither provide all present requirements nor those that may be necessary in the future. An open, community-based tool can be relatively quickly re-purposed and modified to account for nearly any contingency- in the present or the future. All this should be possible with minimal time investment and assistance from an open source community.</p>

<p><strong>Fourth</strong>, most of these data collection systems require either a wireless local network or a connection to a cellular network so that the collection tool, such as a tablet, can communicate with the database on a server. While this is logistically feasible for many (especially small, localized) excavations, they are not applicable to field survey. For these tools to be used in field survey, a cellular connection is required. The tool we hope to design can be used offline and then synchronized with a database once a connection is established.</p>

<p><strong>Fifth</strong>, while there are some serviceable open-source projects, these are platform specific (e.g., FAIMS is designed for Android). We prefer a browser based system in order to avoid the problems associated with restricting tools to a particular platform. We would like to build a field data collection system that is open, inexpensive, highly flexible, browser-based, and can be used offline. We believe that this exists in a set of open-source software known as wq.io.</p>

<h2 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h2>

<p>The goal of my project- or rather OUR project for I am working with a fellow institute participant who will have a separate post and other partners are being courted- is to develop a tool that remedies these issues. We hope that the end product of this project is a tool that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Is browser-based (and, therefore, device independent)</li>
  <li>Can be used off-line (now possible with HTML5)</li>
  <li>Employs open source code</li>
  <li>Can be connected to a database of choice (proprietary or open-source)</li>
  <li>Is inexpensive and simple (at least on the user end once it has been built)</li>
  <li>Promotes the open use of resulting data</li>
</ol>

<p>We realize that this is a bit of a pipe dream for we will never be able to do all of this in one year. We plan to have a working prototype. We are feverishly working to figure out the details- more on that in coming posts.</p>
