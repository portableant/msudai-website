# The Institute on Digital Archaeology Method &amp; Practice

This project is a **recreated website** using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), based on content pulled from the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/). Please note that some images and possibly some text are missing due to incomplete archival.

## History

The Institute on Digital Archaeology Method & Practice was originally established to bring together scholars, technologists, and practitioners interested in the intersection of archaeology and digital methods. The institute hosted workshops, collaborative projects, and discussions focused on advancing digital tools and methodologies for archaeological research and public engagement. Its website served as a hub for sharing resources, event information, and outcomes from its initiatives, contributing to the broader field of digital humanities.

## Funding and Leadership

The Institute on Digital Archaeology Method & Practice was funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). The project was led by Ethan Watrall and Lynne Goldstein, whose guidance and expertise were instrumental in shaping the institute's vision and activities.

## Getting Started

To run the site locally, use the scripts defined in `package.json`:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve the site locally
npm run develop
```

This will start a local server, usually at `http://localhost:4000`, where you can browse the reconstructed site.

## Technologies Used and Migration

The original website was built with WordPress using the Divi theme. For this reconstruction, the site was migrated to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a static site generator, providing a lightweight and easily maintainable structure. [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) was integrated for responsive design and modern UI components. This transition improves performance, simplifies deployment, and ensures long-term accessibility of the site's content.

## Notes

- **Missing Content:** Some images and text could not be recovered from the archive.
- **Purpose:** This was just recreated so that it was easy to point to what we did.
