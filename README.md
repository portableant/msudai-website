# The Institute on Digital Archaeology Method &amp; Practice

![MSU Digital Archaeology Institute Logo](/images/logos/InstituteDigitalArch-Logo-35.png)

This project is a **recreated website** using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), based on content pulled from the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/). Please note that some images and possibly some text are missing due to incomplete archival.

**This website reconstruction is not affiliated with MSU, but it is dedicated to Lynne Goldstein and Ethan Watrall, who organised the Institute. I am very fond of them for all that they did. MSUDAI forever. Where did the DH unicorn go?**

## History

The Institute on Digital Archaeology Method & Practice was originally established to bring together scholars, technologists, and practitioners interested in the intersection of archaeology and digital methods. The institute hosted workshops, collaborative projects, and discussions focused on advancing digital tools and methodologies for archaeological research and public engagement. Its website served as a hub for sharing resources, event information, and outcomes from its initiatives, contributing to the broader field of digital humanities.

## Funding and Leadership

The Institute on Digital Archaeology Method & Practice was funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). The project was led by Ethan Watrall and Lynne Goldstein, whose guidance and expertise were instrumental in shaping the institute's vision and activities.

## Who contributed?
The project was a collaborative effort involving numerous faculty members, students, and participants from various institutions.
The contributions included developing digital tools, creating educational resources, and conducting research that utilized digital methods in archaeology. The collaborative nature of the institute fostered a rich exchange of ideas and practices, enhancing the understanding and application of digital archaeology across different contexts.

I have no doubt missed some people, so please let me know if you were involved and I will add you to the list.

## Getting Started

To run the site locally, use the scripts defined in `package.json`:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve the site locally
npm run develop
```

This will start a local server, usually at `http://localhost:4000`, where you can browse the reconstructed site.

## Technologies Used and Migration

The original website was built with WordPress using the Divi theme. For this reconstruction, the site was migrated to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a static site generator, providing a lightweight and easily maintainable structure. [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) was integrated for responsive design and modern UI components. This transition improves performance, simplifies deployment, and ensures long-term accessibility of the site's content.

## Images are missing
Due to the nature of the migration and the limitations of the Wayback Machine, some images and other media files may not have been captured or are not available. The site structure and content have been preserved as closely as possible, but please note that some visual elements may be missing or replaced with placeholders. If you have access to the original images or media files, you can manually add them to the appropriate directories in the `_posts` or `images` folders. Or let me know and I will try to add them.

## PageSpeed Insights and Carbon Footprint

The reconstructed site was evaluated using [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to ensure fast load times and optimal performance across devices. Efforts were made to minimize JavaScript, optimize images, and leverage static site benefits for improved speed. The majority of pages are scoring above 90 for performance, and 100 for accessibility, best practices, and SEO.

Additionally, the site's carbon footprint was assessed using tools like [Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com/). By migrating to a static architecture and reducing unnecessary assets, the site aims to lower energy consumption and environmental impact compared to traditional dynamic websites. The current iteration is scoring a carbon footprint of 0.1g CO2 per page view, which is considered very low - a [grade A rating](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/msudai-museologi-st/).

## Notes

- **Missing Content:** Some images and text could not be recovered from the archive.
- **Purpose:** This was just recreated so that it was easy to point to what we did.
